            "1. **Visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island**: Take a ferry to Liberty Island to see the iconic Statue of Liberty up close. You can also visit the Ellis Island Immigration Museum to learn about the history of immigration in the United States. This is a must-do experience that offers breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Explore the Metropolitan Museum of Art**: The Met, as it's affectionately known, is one of the world's largest and most famous museums. With a collection that spans over 5,000 years of human history, you'll find something to fascinate you, from ancient Egyptian artifacts to modern art. The museum's grand architecture and beautiful gardens are also worth exploring.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge**: This iconic bridge offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline, the East River, and Brooklyn. Take a leisurely walk across the bridge, stop at the Brooklyn Bridge Park for some great food and drinks, and enjoy the street performers and live music. This is a great way to experience the city's energy and beauty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, there are many more things to see and do in New York, but these three experiences will give you a taste of the city's history, culture, and natural beauty.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Visit the 9/11 Memorial & Museum\n",
            "- Take a stroll through Central Park\n",
            "- Catch a Broadway show\n",
            "- Explore the High Line\n",
            "- Visit the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)\n",
